<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![product-screenshot](./ss/ss.png)

Veuzion is a SaaS product that allows schools, colleges, universities to utilize the power of the new technologies to easily organize their institute results for free of cost.

There are many RMS - Result managament systems out there but they comes with a cost. only few schools, collages and universites can afford these products. 

A version of veuzion part is always free for these educational institutes.

Here's why:
* More than 460 thousand private schools and 36k+ colleges didn’t have the platform to post their results.

* Institutes have the RMS system but they are not well managed which makes the frequent cause of the server outage, and they are costly.

* As of 2018 in India, the number of government schools in India was
over a million while the privately managed schools were 460
thousand. 
* The Indian schooling system is one of the largest in the
world and caters to over 250 million students. 944 universities, 36,308 colleges and 9,090 stand-alone institutions
